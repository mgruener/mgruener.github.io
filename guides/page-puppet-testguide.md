Automating Puppet Testing - A Step-by-Step Guide
================================================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Millenux/puppet-testguide.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Millenux/puppet-testguide)

So you want to develop a puppet module and want to use all these nice tools
like GitHub (version control / collaboration), Travis CI (continuous
integration) and puppet-rspec (unit testing for puppet code).

This document will guide you step by step through the process, from uploading
your puppet module to GitHub to releasing it on the [PuppetForge][]

Let's get started!

0. Initial Situation
--------------------

The starting point for this guide is a simple module, lets call it
"testguide". The layout of this module on the filesystem is
as follows:

~~~
testguide/
└──manifests/
   │  init.pp
~~~

A _really_ simple module. For details on how to structure module have a look
at the official [ModuleLayoutDocumentation][] on this topic.
And while you are there read the [PuppetStyleGuide][] also.

To have something to test later on, init.pp contains a clase containing one
file resource:

~~~puppet
class testguide ( $world ) {
  file { '/tmp/hello.txt':
    ensure  => file,
    content => "Hello ${world}!\\n"
  }
}
~~~

This small class (with the mandatory parameter $world) will create a fille
`/tmp/hello.txt` containing the text "Hello ..." with whatever you passed
as the $world parameter. I will not go into the details of Puppet itself so
if you need an introduction I suggest you head to the [LearningPuppet][] 
website.

1. Version Control with Git and GitHub
--------------------------------------

Now that we have our module, we want to track changes to it and allow others
to contribute. A really nice way to do this is by using [Git][] and to publish
your code on [GitHub][]. If you do not already have an account there, I suggest
you create one and follow the steps in the [SettingUpGitGuide][].

So we have our GitHub account. As the next step we need to
[CreateAGitRepository][] on our new account. I will call the repository
"puppet-testguide". The "puppet-" prefix allows me to easily distinguish this
repository as a puppet module. I suggest you do the same with your puppet module
repository as this is also common practice.

Lets add our small module to the puppet-testguide repository:

~~~shell-session
[mgruener@devel testguide]$ git init
Initialized empty Git repository in /home/mgruener/git/testguide/.git/
[mgruener@devel testguide]$ git add .
[mgruener@devel testguide]$ git commit -m 'Initial commit'
[master (root-commit) dbb6293] Initial commit
1 file changed, 6 insertions(+)
create mode 100644 manifests/init.pp
[mgruener@devel testguide]$ git remote add origin https://github.com/Millenux/puppet-testguide.git
[mgruener@devel testguide]$ git push origin master
Username for 'https://github.com': mgruener
Password for 'https://mgruener@github.com':

Total 4 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)
To https://github.com/Millenux/puppet-testguide.git
* [new branch]      master -> master
[mgruener@devel testguide]$
~~~

Our code is now available online. To allow others to contribute we should add
a readme explaining what our puppet module does and we should add a license
to explain under which conditions others can use/modify our code.

For the sake of this document the readme will be this document itself and the
license will be [GPL][]. GPL is normally a safe bet when choosing a license. It is
widely known and it is easy to publish GPL licensed puppet modules on the
Puppet Forge.

The readme should be called `README.md` and be written in the [Markdown][]
format. This file will be rendered as HTML when accessing the GitHub repository
from a browser. You probably read this guide right now like this. This file
will later also be used as documentation for your module on the Puppet Forge.

The license should be documented in a file called `LICENSE`. You could name
it anyway you want but calling it `LICENSE` is common practice and will also
be recogniced by GitHub when determining under which license your repository
operates.

~~~shell-session
[mgruener@devel testguide]$ touch README.md
# describe your puppet module in your README.md
[mgruener@devel testguide]$ touch LICENSE
# add whatever license you desire
[mgruener@devel testguide]$ git add README.md LICENSE
[mgruener@devel testguide]$ git commit -m 'Add readme and license'
[mgruener@devel testguide]$ git push origin master
~~~

We now have a module that is version controlled and available to whoever wants
to contribute. The module has a readme explaining what it does and a license
permitting others to use and modify the code. In the following parts of this
guide I will assume that you know how to handle git well enought without
me mentioning each and every step to upload your new code to the repository.
If you need help with that I suggest you read a [GitGuide][].

2. Continuous integration for syntax checking using Travis CI
-------------------------------------------------------------

If you followed this guide up till now, you will probably have read some
guides regarding Puppet and GitHub. Maybe you even stumbled over this
nice Puppetlabs blog post regarding [AutomatedTestingForPuppet][].

__If__ you have, the following steps should seem familiar to you:

~~~shell-session
[mgruener@devel testguide]$ puppet parser validate manifests/init.pp
[mgruener@devel testguide]$ puppet-lint manifests/init.pp
WARNING: parameterised class parameter without a default value on line 1
WARNING: class not documented on line 1
[mgruener@devel testguide]$
~~~

The first command performs a syntax check on your puppet code, the second one
performs a style check. If you see these commands for the first time, remember
them and use them. Really. They will save you from a lot of headaches and help
keeping your code maintainable. 

So now we check our puppet code for syntax and style problems __before__
commiting the changes. But what about contributions from other people or when
we forget to do these checks manually? These steps should be performed
whenever new code enters our upstream repository on GitHub. And it should
be easily visible to everyone to see if our code passed these basic tests.

Maybe you have seen some puppet modules on the Puppet Forge and on GitHub
which had a small icon stating "build passing" (or even "build failing") in
their README.md. The same as the one that can be found at the top of this
guide.

This is the build status for this repository on [TravisCI][]. Travis CI is
a free (at least for public repositories) continuous integration service
neatly integrated with GitHub. Everytime someone pushes code to a registered
repository, Travis CI "builds" the code contained in this repository according
to a set of specifications. For puppet "building" means "run some tests".

Now to automate our syntax/style checks we need a Travis CI account. Nothing is
easier than that because you can create one with your GitHub credentials. Go
[SignIn][] to Travis CI and [ActivateGitHubWebhook][] for your repository.

The basic preparations for our automated checks are now complete. Now we have
to tell Travis CI what to do when someone pushes code to our repository. From
a Travis CI point of view a puppet module is Ruby code so we can use the
[TravisCIRubyDocumentation][] as basis for our configuration. To build a ruby
project we will need 3 files:

  * [.travis.yml][]
  
    The main Travis CI configuration file for this repository. Defines what
    should be build how (especially with which versions)

  * Gemfile

    Defines which Ruby [Gems][] should be installed for the build. This file
    is used by the Ruby tool "[bundler][]". If Travis CI finds this file in a
    repository, it treats the repository as Ruby code.

  * Rakefile

    A Makefile, just for Ruby. It is used by the Ruby tool "[rake][]".

We need these files because in the basic configuration, Travis CI performs
the following actions when it detects a new push to the repository:

~~~shell-session
[user@host ~]$ git clone --depth=50 --branch=master <repo>
[user@host ~]$ git checkout -qf <commitid>
[user@host ~]$ ... <setup ruby version> ...
[user@host ~]$ bundle install
[user@host ~]$ bundle exec rake
~~~

Nothing spectacular and really nothing that defines _how_ our code is tested.
We are free to define this however we want, using the files mentioned above.
Lets start with defining the environment in which we want to test, meaning the
Ruby and Puppet versions we want to use while testing:

.travis.yml:

~~~yaml
---
rvm:
- 1.8.7
- 1.9.3
env:
- PUPPET_VERSION=">= 3.0.0"
- PUPPET_VERSION="~> 2.7"
~~~

This is all there is Travis CI itself needs to now about our code. The rvm
part is interpreted by Travis CI and the "PUPPET_VERSION" is an environment
variable that we will use in the next step. The configuration shown above
will test our code in four environments:

  * Ruby 1.8.7 + Puppet 3.x.x
  * Ruby 1.8.7 + Puppet 2.7.x
  * Ruby 1.9.3 + Puppet 3.x.x
  * Ruby 1.9.3 + Puppet 2.7.x

Now that we have defined our build environments, we have to tell bundler what
to install in each environment. For this we have the Gemfile:

Gemfile:

~~~ruby
source 'https://rubygems.org'

if ENV.key?('PUPPET_VERSION')
  puppetversion = "#{ENV['PUPPET_VERSION']}"
else
  puppetversion = ['~> 2.7']
end

gem 'puppet', puppetversion, :require => false
gem 'puppet-lint'
gem 'rake'
~~~

Here you can see how the PUPPET_VERSION environment variable from the
`.travis.yml` file is used. The if/else construct is just a safety net in case
no Puppet version was specified in the environment. This will probably not
happen when building with Travis CI but it can happen when you execute bundler
for example on your development system (I will provide an example on how to do
this later in this guide).

Puppet as well as puppet-lint are both Ruby gems so we can install them on this
way, and in the case of puppet, also with a specific version.

The real "magic" happens in the Rakefile. Here the actual tasks that should be
performed in our build environment are defined.

Rakefile:

~~~ruby
require 'rubygems'
require 'puppet-lint/tasks/puppet-lint'
PuppetLint.configuration.send('disable_80chars')
PuppetLint.configuration.send('disable_class_inherits_from_params_class')
PuppetLint.configuration.ignore_paths = ["spec/**/*.pp", "pkg/**/*.pp","examples/**/*.pp"]

desc "Validate manifests, templates, and ruby files in lib."
task :validate do
  Dir['manifests/**/*.pp'].each do |manifest|
    sh "puppet parser validate --noop #{manifest}"
  end
end

task :default => [:lint, :validate]
~~~

In this file we tell Ruby we want to use code from the rubygems and puppet-lint
Gems. We also set some basic options for puppet-lint (the lines with
PuppetLint.configuration directives). For details see the [PuppetLintChecks][]
documentationWe also tell Ruby which "tasks" have to be performed. When
executing rake without parameters it will perform the ":default" task. In our
case this will in turn perform the ":lint" task (defined in the puppet-lint
gem) and the ":validate" task (defined in this file).

And thats it with the basic Travis CI integration. When you create these files
and push them to your repository, Travis CI will pick up the change and perform
the steps we just described. And hopefully it will say "build passed".

3. Adding advanced puppet features - templates and plugins
----------------------------------------------------------

In the previous step we integrated our puppet module repository hosted on GitHub
with Travis CI to automate some basic checks for our module. In this small step
we add some advanced features to our module. These features are [templates][]
and plugins. Calling templates an "advanced" feature of puppet may seem far
fetched but they involve touching raw ruby code with all the advantages and
especially risks.

Before we can test anything we have to extend our module so lets do that first.
And because they are pretty common we will start with adding a template. The
directory structure of the module has to be extended like this:

~~~
testguide/
├──manifests/
│     init.pp
│
└──templates/
   │  hello.erb
~~~

And the contents of the template are as follows:

~~~erb
<% if @world -%>
Hello <%= @world %>
<% end -%>
~~~

Nothing really creative but...well, this is a guide on testing and not on
creating nice puppet modules. Now we only have to modify our puppet manifest
`init.pp` to look like this:

~~~puppet
class testguide ( $world ) {
  file { '/tmp/hello.txt':
    ensure  => file,
    content => template('testguide/hello.erb')
  }
}
~~~
 
This does exactly the same as before but it uses a template to accomplish that.
To syntax check our template, we would have to execute the following statement:

~~~shell-session
[mgruener@devel testguide]$ erb -P -x -T '-' templates/hello.erb | ruby -c
~~~

The last step, at least in regard to templates, is to integrate this into our
test setup. The only file we have to modify is the Rakefile where we extend the
":validate" task:

~~~ruby
require 'rubygems'
require 'puppet-lint/tasks/puppet-lint'
PuppetLint.configuration.send('disable_80chars')
PuppetLint.configuration.send('disable_class_inherits_from_params_class')
PuppetLint.configuration.ignore_paths = ["spec/**/*.pp", "pkg/**/*.pp","examples/**/*.pp"]

desc "Validate manifests, templates, and ruby files in lib."
task :validate do
  Dir['manifests/**/*.pp'].each do |manifest|
    sh "puppet parser validate --noop #{manifest}"
  end
  Dir['templates/**/*.erb'].each do |template|
    sh "erb -P -x -T '-' #{template} | ruby -c"
  end
end

task :default => [:lint, :validate]
~~~

Thats it, we added templates to our module and included them in our test setup.

Next up are plugins. Plugins can be used to extend Puppet functionality beyond
the capabilities of the Puppet language used in manifests. They normally are
used to implement new [ResourceTypes][] or [Functions][]. We will add a simple
function to our module. Lets start by extending the directory structure

~~~
testguide/
├──manifests/
│     init.pp
│
├──templates/
│  │  hello.erb
│
└──lib/
   └──puppet/
      └──parser/
         └──functions/
            │  sequence_string.rb
~~~

Pretty complex structure just for one file. Anyway, the contents of our
`sequence_string.rb` file is as follows:

~~~ruby
module Puppet::Parser::Functions
  newfunction(:sequence_string, :type => :rvalue, :doc => <<-EOS
Takes a string and returns the sequence substr1,substr1substr2,substr1substr2substr3,...

*Example*

    sequence_string("/this/is/a/test","/")

Would result in:

    ["/","/this/","/this/is/","/this/is/a/","/this/is/a/test"]
    EOS
  ) do |arguments|
    str = arguments[0]
    separator = arguments[1] ? arguments[1] : '/'
    sequence = [arguments[2]]
    str.each_line(separator) do |part|
      sequence << "#{sequence[-1]}#{part}"
    end
    if arguments[2]
      sequence.shift
    end
    return sequence.compact
  end
end
~~~

If you want to know what all this code means, have a look at the
[CustomFunctionsGuide][] at Puppetlabs.

To see this function in action we integrate it in our testguide class:

~~~puppet
class testguide ( $world ) {

  $path = "some/useless/directory"
  $directories = sequence_string($path,"/","/tmp/")
  file { $directories:
    ensure => directory,
  }

  file { "/tmp/${path}/hello.txt":
    ensure  => file,
    content => template('testguide/hello.erb')
  }
}
~~~

Our plugin is now ready. Before uploading our new code we should add a way to
test it. As it was the case with templates we only have to extend the
":validate" task of our Rakefile:

~~~ruby
require 'rubygems'
require 'puppet-lint/tasks/puppet-lint'
PuppetLint.configuration.send('disable_80chars')
PuppetLint.configuration.send('disable_class_inherits_from_params_class')
PuppetLint.configuration.ignore_paths = ["spec/**/*.pp", "pkg/**/*.pp","examples/**/*.pp"]

desc "Validate manifests, templates, and ruby files in lib."
task :validate do
  Dir['manifests/**/*.pp'].each do |manifest|
    sh "puppet parser validate --noop #{manifest}"
  end
  Dir['templates/**/*.erb'].each do |template|
    sh "erb -P -x -T '-' #{template} | ruby -c"
  end
  Dir['lib/**/*.rb'].each do |lib_file|
    sh "ruby -c #{lib_file}"
  end
end

task :default => [:lint, :validate]
~~~

We now have a Puppet module with common resources, a template and a custom
function. And everything is automatically tested the moment we push it to our
repository. Well, sort of. We test for correct syntax and style but we do not
test if our code works as designed. This will be part of the next step.

4. Everything works as specified - rspec puppet
-----------------------------------------------

When a puppet module becomes more complex just checking that it is
syntactically correct and well formatted is not enought. It should also conform
to some sort of specification. For example our testguide class should always
create a file hello.txt containing the text "Hello <ourstring>!". With such
a specification (and test setup that automatically tests our code against it)
we can limit the cases where someone accidentally breaks our code. He has to
break it on purpose. As a side note, GitHub triggers Travis CI builds for pull
requests so you instantly see when someone wants to contribute code that breaks
your precious Puppet module!

To test ruby code there exists a nice tool called [rspec][]. And because rspec
provides a really good way to test your code, someone created [rspec-puppet][]
to spec-test your puppet code (which is based on ruby after all) the same way.

To create spec-tests for our module we first have to prepare it. There is a
manual way to to this described on the rspec-puppet website. But I am lazy and
prefer best-practice-gone-code so we will use the [puppetlabs-spec-helper][].
For some more details on this spec-helper have a look at the
[NextGenerationofPuppetModuleTesting][] blogpost at Puppetlabs.

First we have to add the puppetlabs_spec_helper Gem to our `Gemfile`:

~~~ruby
source 'https://rubygems.org'

if ENV.key?('PUPPET_VERSION')
  puppetversion = "#{ENV['PUPPET_VERSION']}"
else
  puppetversion = ['~> 2.7']
end

gem 'puppet', puppetversion, :require => false
gem 'puppet-lint'
gem 'rake'
gem 'puppetlabs_spec_helper', '>= 0.1.0'
~~~

Then we have to add the Rake tasks provided by the spec-helper to our
`Rakefile` and tell it to execute them as part of the ":default" task:

~~~ruby
require 'rubygems'
require 'puppet-lint/tasks/puppet-lint'
require 'puppetlabs_spec_helper/rake_tasks'
PuppetLint.configuration.send('disable_80chars')
PuppetLint.configuration.send('disable_class_inherits_from_params_class')
PuppetLint.configuration.ignore_paths = ["spec/**/*.pp", "pkg/**/*.pp","examples/**/*.pp"]

desc "Validate manifests, templates, and ruby files in lib."
task :validate do
  Dir['manifests/**/*.pp'].each do |manifest|
    sh "puppet parser validate --noop #{manifest}"
  end
  Dir['templates/**/*.erb'].each do |template|
    sh "erb -P -x -T '-' #{template} | ruby -c"
  end
  Dir['lib/**/*.rb'].each do |lib_file|
    sh "ruby -c #{lib_file}"
  end
end

task :default => [:lint, :validate, :spec]
~~~

The ":spec" task provided by the puppetlabs_spec_helper/rake_tasks will create
the so called "fixtures", run the spec tests and clean up afterwards.

`puppetlabs_spec_helper` also needs a new file in our module: `.fixtures.yml`.
Similiar to the `Gemfile` used by bundler, the `.fixtures.yml` file describes
the test environment used by rspec-puppet. It contains a list of components
(repositories, files and so on along with their respective versions) that
should be present in our test environment.

In our case this is simple, we only need the module we like to test:

~~~yaml
fixtures:
  symlinks:
    testguide: "#{source_dir}"
~~~

Next we will prepare the directory structure for our spec-tests and add a
`spec_helper.rb`. This file includes things common to all our spec-tests and we
will require it in each one.

~~~
testguide/
│  .fixtures.yml
│
├──manifests/
│  init.pp
│
├──templates/
│  │  hello.erb
│
├──lib/
│  └──puppet/
│     └──parser/
│        └──functions/
│           │  sequence_string.rb
└──spec/
   └──classes/
      └──functions/
         │  spec_helper.rb
~~~

In our case the `spec_helper.rb` is really simple:

~~~ruby
require 'rubygems'
require 'puppetlabs_spec_helper/module_spec_helper'
~~~

All the actual work is done by the puppetlabs_spec_helper. With all the
preparations finished we can start to create the actual spec-tests.

You may have noticed that we created "classes" and a "functions" directory. As
you might have guessed the spec files to test classes belong in the classes
directory and the spec tests to test functions belong to the functions
directory. There could also be directories for "defines" and "hosts" but as
we do not have any of these in our module we do not need them.

Aside from where your test files should be located you also have to name them
correctly. Testfiles always have the format `<name>_spec.rb` where <name> is a
class name, a function name, and so on. In our case we need two test files
`sequence_string_spec.rb` (to test our custom function) and `testguide_spec.rb`
(to test our testguide class). As a side note, if you want to test something
like "mymodule::myclass" you would call your test file `myclass_spec.rb`.

Lets start with the specification for our sequence_string function:

sequence_string_spec.rb:

~~~ruby
require 'spec_helper'

describe 'sequence_string' do
  describe 'when called only with a single string parameter' do
    it do
      should run.with_params('/this/is/a/test').and_return(['/','/this/','/this/is/','/this/is/a/','/this/is/a/test'])
    end
  end

  describe 'when called with a string and a separator' do
    it do
      should run.with_params('!this!is!a!test','!').and_return(['!','!this!','!this!is!','!this!is!a!','!this!is!a!test'])
    end
  end

  describe 'when called with a string, separator and a prefix' do
    it do
      should run.with_params('!this!is!a!test','!','!tmp').and_return(['!tmp!','!tmp!this!','!tmp!this!is!','!tmp!this!is!a!','!tmp!this!is!a!test'])
    end
  end
end
~~~

Even tests for simple things can get complex really fast as you can see on this
example. And this spec test is not even complete (for example I do not test if
the functions checks if it was called with at least one parameter).

The only thing to note here is the first "describe" statement. It should use
the exact name of what should be tested (in our case the function
"sequence_string") as parameter. All later describe statements can use what
ever string describes the situation best.

Lets have a look at our test file for the testguide class:

testguide_spec.rb:

~~~ruby
require 'spec_helper'

describe 'testguide', :type => :class do
  let(:params) { { :world => 'Kitty!' } }

  it do
    should contain_file('/tmp/some/useless/directory/hello.txt') \
      .with_content("Hello Kitty!\n")
  end

  it do
    should contain_file('/tmp/some/')
  end
  it do
    should contain_file('/tmp/some/useless/')
  end
  it do
    should contain_file('/tmp/some/useless/directory')
  end
end
~~~

It does look quite similar to the test file for the sequence_string but instead
of testing the return value of some function, we test that our class contains
certain resources. Testing for our hello.txt resource is obvious. But why are
there tests for three different other file resources representing directories?
Our testguide class only manages the "/tmp/some/useless/directory" directory.
Or does it? Well, sequence_string returns an array, in this case

~~~puppet
$directories = ['/tmp/some/,'/tmp/some/useless/','/tmp/some/useless/directory']
~~~

which we pass to `file { $directories:`. This way we create three different
file resources, one for each level of directories.

Everything else said about the sequence_string test is also true for this test
of a puppet class. The parameter to the first describe statement must be the
exact name of the class to test. In this case it is "testguide" but if you want
to test "mymodule::myclass" it has to be "mymodule::myclass" (contrary to the
way the test files are named, where only the last part is necessary).

And thats it. We now have a (somewhat lacking) specification against which we
can test our Puppet code. You really should read the [RspecPuppetTutorial][]
where some of the finer details of these spec tests are explained. Push your
changes to your repository on GitHub and watch Travis CI do its magic.

Your module is now ready to be uploaded to the Puppet Forge to be made
available to a broad audience (who probably will tear it to pieces the
first time around but well... thats life).

5. The big big world - publishing the module on the Puppet Forge
----------------------------------------------------------------

After writing, extending and testing our module, it is now ready to be
published. For this purpose PuppetLabs provides the Puppet Forge. But
before we can do this we need to add some information to our module.
This includes a proper name, a version, dependencies and some other
metadata.

For details on publishing modules I recommend you read
[PublishingModulesonthePuppetForge][]. For the sake of this guide I will
give a short explanation on what has to be done.

We start by creating a metadata.json file in our module directory. As the
name suggests, this file conains all the relevant metadata about the module.
The mandatory fields are:

  * name
  * version
  * author
  * license
  * summary
  * source
  * dependencies
  
Optional fields:

  * project_page
  * issues_url
  * operatingsystem_support
  * tags

Nothing fancy here, really. Well maybe the operatingsystem_support and
dependencies fields (which we incidentally do not cover here) but just have a
close look at the example provided at the document mentioned above and you will
see how the work.

Without much further ado, the metadata.json file for our module:

~~~json
{
  "name": "millenux-testguide",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "author": "millenux",
  "summary": "A guide on the creation and test of puppet modules in the form of a puppet module.",
  "license": "GPL",
  "source": "git://github.com/Millenux/puppet-testguide.git",
  "project_page": "https://github.com/Millenux/puppet-testguide",
  "issues_url": "https://github.com/Millenux/puppet-testguide/issues",
  "tags": [
    "guide",
    "modules",
    "puppet"
  ],
  "dependencies": [
  
  ]
}
~~~

The name __has__ to be "username-modulename", where "username" is the
username you intend to use for the Puppet Forge account. With this file
present, we can build a module file.

~~~shell-session
[mgruener@devel ~]$ cd git/puppet-testguide

[mgruener@devel puppet-testguide]$ puppet module changes pkg/millenux-testguide-1.0.0
Notice: No modified files

[mgruener@devel puppet-testguide]$ 
~~~

We now have a module file that can be used by others to install our module. To
prevent git from versioning the directory containing the released files, we add
a small .gitignore file:

~~~shell-session
[mgruener@devel puppet-testguide]$ echo "pkg/" > .gitignore
~~~

What is left to be done is the actual publishing of the module. Head to
[PuppetForgeSignup][], create an account, login and hit the big green
"Publish a Module" button. Follow the instructions (you do not need me
to explain to you how to do that, do you?) and upload the
previously created module file (millenux-testguide-1.0.0.tar.gz).

Congratulations, you just have created your first puppet module, added
automated testing and published it for others to find, use and criticize.
